# Bank-Loan-Case-Study

## Problem Statement

1. Loan-providing companies find it hard to provide loans to the applicants due to their insufficient and non-existent credit history.
2. Some of the clients are using it to their advantage by becoming defaulters. For this reason, the companies are facing losses.
3. Due to these reasons sometimes clients capable of paying the installments are getting rejected. So it also impacts the business of the companies.
4. When the companies are providing the loan to the clients who are not capable of paying the loans then it may lead to financial losses.
   
   To find the solution to this problem and identify the patterns of becoming a defaulter I need to use EDA to analyse from the provided data. This analysis will help the loan-providing companies to ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not getting rejected.

## Goals of the analysis

1. Identifying the patterns of the clients who are not capable of repaying the loan. So the companies can deny the loan, reduce the loan amount or provide the loan amount at a higher interest rate.
2. The clients who are capable of paying the loan are not getting rejected.
3. The companies also want to understand the driving factors behind loan default, which variables are strong indicators of loan default.
